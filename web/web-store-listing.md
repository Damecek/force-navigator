Force Navigator Reloaded is a lightning-fast command palette for Salesforce Lightning.  
Open any SObject list view, or Setup page without ever touching the mouse.

• One-Keystroke Command Palette  
Press Ctrl + Shift + L (or ⌘ + Shift + P on macOS) to summon the palette from anywhere in Lightning.\*

• Blazing-Fast Search & Navigation  
Type the name of a SObject, list, new, or Setup item and hit Enter—no more menu-digging.

• Live, Dynamic Commands  
The extension pulls object metadata and Setup menu items directly from your org and caches them for instant reuse.

• Native Salesforce Look & Feel  
Built with Lightning Web Components and the Salesforce Lightning Design System, so it feels like it’s part of the
platform.

• 100 % Open Source  
Browse the code, file issues, or submit pull requests on GitHub: <https://github.com/Damecek/force-navigator-reloaded>.

\*You can customise the shortcut in Chrome at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
