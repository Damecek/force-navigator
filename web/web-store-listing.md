Force Navigator Reloaded is a lightning-fast command palette for Salesforce Lightning.  
Open any SObject list view, flow, or Setup page without ever touching the mouse.

• One-Keystroke Command Palette  
Press Ctrl + Shift + L (or ⌘ + Shift + P on macOS) to summon the palette from anywhere in Lightning.\*

• Blazing-Fast Search & Navigation  
Type the name of an SObject, flow, or Setup item and hit Enter—no more menu-digging.

• Configurable Command Sources  
Control which types of commands (e.g., Setup menu items, SObjects, Flow versions) are fetched and displayed in your
command palette via the extension settings—simply edit the JSON configuration to fine‑tune the list.

• Live, Dynamic Commands  
The extension pulls object metadata and Setup menu items directly from your org and caches them for instant reuse.

• Native Salesforce Look & Feel  
Built with Lightning Web Components and the Salesforce Lightning Design System, so it feels like it’s part of the
platform.

• 100 % Open Source

\*You can customise the shortcut in Chrome at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
