# Salesforce Navigator for Lightning
**[Available on Chrome Web Store now](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-navigator-for/pbjjdhghffpemcglcadejmkcpnpmlklh)**

## Now supports Lightning
Get more done in Salesforce - list and search records, make new ones, create a task or login as on the fly!

This extension helps you get to any Salesforce page quickly. Just type in what you need to do!
Compatible with Lightning and Classic

NOTE: If you have a custom instance Domain Name, you must create a CSP Trusted Site Definition for your Classic domain URL in order for this extension to work - more info here https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/csp_trusted_sites.htm

Open the search bar and go straight to:
- [NEW FEATURE] Add tasks on the fly by typing "! <your task>"
- [NEW FEATURE] Search all records with "? <search terms>"
- Object List views with "List <Object>"
- Create a new record with "New <Object>"
- Go directly a Setup page by typing it's name
- Access Object customizations with "<Object> <Section>" (e.g. "Contact Fields")
- Go to your Home page with "Home"
- Switch between Lightning and Classic with "Toggle Lightning"
- Switch between Detailed and Simple mode with "Toggle Detailed Mode"
- Commands looking weird? Run "Refresh Metadata" to make sure you have what you need
- Login as another user with "Login as <partial match of username>"

All commands work with partial matches, for instance typing "li cas" will select "List Cases"

Press Enter or click on the option to run the command, or hold Ctrl or Shift and press Enter to open it in a new tab
