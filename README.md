## Overview

Force Navigator Reloaded is a Chrome Extension for Salesforce Lightning that provides fast and efficient navigation
within Salesforce environments. This extension implements a command palette interface that allows users to quickly
search, navigate, and perform actions without leaving their keyboard.

## Features

- **Command Palette**: Access a powerful command interface with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
- **Fast Navigation**: Quickly search and navigate to Salesforce records, list views, and setup pages
- **SLDS Integration**: Uses Salesforce Lightning Design System for a native look and feel
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with [LWC OSS](https://lwc.dev/) (Lightning Web Components) for composable UI
- **Dynamic Setup Menu Commands**: Fetches and caches Salesforce setup menu items directly from your org for quick access

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

_Coming soon_

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the extension
4. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory from this project

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Salesforce Lightning page
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the command palette
3. Type commands or search terms to find what you need
4. Press Enter to execute the selected command

## Development

### Project Structure

- **Background Script** (`src/background`): Service worker that manages extension lifecycle, listens for keyboard
  commands, and handles cross-context communication
- **Content Script** (`src/content_scripts`): Injects the LWC app into Salesforce pages and handles communication with
  the background script
- **LWC Components** (`src/content_scripts/modules/x`): Lightning Web Components that provide the UI for the command
  palette
- **Popup** (`src/popup.html/js`): Extension popup interface (currently a basic scaffold)

### Build & Toolchain

- **Webpack + Babel**: Builds and bundles the extension into `dist/`
- **LWC**: Uses Lightning Web Components via lwc-webpack-plugin
- **Code Quality**: Prettier and ESLint configured with Salesforce LWC standards
- **Git Hooks**: Husky pre-commit hook runs formatting
- **CI Build**: A GitHub Action builds `dist/` on each commit to main, zips it as `force-navigator-reloaded.zip`, and attaches it to the latest GitHub release

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build`: Build the extension for production
- `npm run dev`: Build with watch mode for development
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on source files
- `npm run lint-fix`: Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
 - `npm test`: Run Jest unit tests with coverage reporting

## Testing

All backend logic is covered by Jest unit tests. New features must include
corresponding tests. Coverage of at least **80%** is enforced by Jest.
The test suite runs automatically in GitHub Actions for pull requests
targeting `main`.

## Roadmap

See [backlog.md](backlog.md) for planned features and development tasks.
